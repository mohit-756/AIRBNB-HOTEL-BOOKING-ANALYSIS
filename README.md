# AIRBNB-HOTEL-BOOKING-ANALYSIS
Problem Statement
Airbnb has transformed urban tourism, but in major cities, some neighborhoods are overcrowded with listings while others remain underutilized.
This creates issues like pricing imbalance, inconsistent availability, and uneven guest experiences.

Our goal is to analyze Airbnb data and highlight patterns in listings, hosts, and reviews.

Project Description
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb Open Data.

Key Objectives:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
Analyze distribution of listings by neighborhood group.
Identify top hosts and their listing counts.
Compare review activity and availability across neighborhoods & room types.
Create meaningful visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, word clouds, etc.).
Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Matplotlib & Seaborn
WordCloud
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
GitHub for hosting

The results here include multiple insights derived from the Airbnb dataset:


.Listings by Neighborhood Group → Shows that Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate the Airbnb market, while Staten Island has very few listings.
.Top 10 Hosts → Reveals that a small number of hosts manage a very large number of listings, showing market concentration.
.Heatmap of Reviews → Highlights how guest review activity and satisfaction vary across neighborhoods and room types.
.Price Distribution → Most listings are affordable (under $200), with a few high-end luxury properties skewing the scale.
.Room Type Analysis → Entire homes/apartments are the most common and also more expensive, while shared rooms are rare and cheaper.
.Availability Trends → Many listings are either available all year (365 days) or not available at all (0 days).
.Geographical Distribution (Map Scatterplot) → Manhattan and Brooklyn appear as dense clusters of listings.
.Correlation Heatmap → Shows weak correlation between price and reviews, but stronger link between reviews per month and number of reviews.
.Word Cloud of Listing Names → Common listing keywords include “Cozy”, “Private”, and “Apartment”, reflecting how hosts market their properties.

Overall, these analyses provide a clear picture of overcrowding in certain neighborhoods, the dominance of specific hosts, and guest activity patterns, which can help both hosts and Airbnb management make better decisions.
