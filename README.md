# AIRBNB-HOTEL-BOOKING-ANALYSIS
Problem Statement
Airbnb has transformed urban tourism, but in major cities, some neighborhoods are overcrowded with listings while others remain underutilized.
This creates issues like pricing imbalance, inconsistent availability, and uneven guest experiences.

Our goal is to analyze Airbnb data and highlight patterns in listings, hosts, and reviews.

Project Description
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb Open Data.

Key Objectives:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
Analyze distribution of listings by neighborhood group.
Identify top hosts and their listing counts.
Compare review activity and availability across neighborhoods & room types.
Create meaningful visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, word clouds, etc.).
Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Matplotlib & Seaborn
WordCloud
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
GitHub for hosting
